## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I have gained a solid understanding of CSS media queries, which allow me to create responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. I also learned how to effectively use HTML div elements to structure web content, ensuring a well-organized and visually appealing layout. My skills in responsive web design enable me to develop websites that provide an optimal user experience across various platforms.


### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me for fetching the font. I really liked this websiteit has all fonts needed for web development.
